This project helped me understand how JavaScript can be used in a professional environment. 
Before this I only had experience with Vanilla JavaScript-HTML-CSS in IS 303, and it's safe to say that my code wasn't up to industry standards. Besides that, most of my other web development experience was in React or other frameworks, and I never really saw how plain JavaScript can be used in such a clean, quality way. 
I learned a lot about how I can break up my code into many functions. I learned how to protect my data processes and clarify my code's execution by distinguishing between public and private functions that index.html can/can't call.
I also took a deep dive into how callback functions work. I had only ever heard them referenced in the React framework, so I didn't really know their original meaning. I learned more about them from how we used them in our ajax function and my own studying, and ended up using those principles in my web development at my work. 
In this project I've accomplished a simple, fully-functioning, bug-resistant web application. This app allows users to navigate across all books of scripture smoothly, while seeing a map of the known places that those scriptures reference, divided by each chapter. I wrote clear and understandable code with solid data-processing logic to the best of my ability.
